# **Ariel Photographs**

Remote sensing data came from **platforms** that carrying **sensors**

-   Early platforms used for aerial photos include balloons and kites, even pigeons

**Aerial Photographs:**

-   (After the WWI, planes and pilots and cameras spread, widespread use in soil surveys ... Today, aerial photography mainly used for historical coverage and with different **spatial resolution**)

-   Aerial photos can take in vertical (creating maps) or oblique (more use in natural purposes (disasters...))

## **Scales of aerial photos**

### **Large-scale VS. small scale**

When we talk about a "larger scale" in aerial photography, it means that the images show a smaller area of the earth's surface but with more detail.

**Larger Scale**: A large-scale aerial photograph covers a smaller area on the ground but shows that area in greater detail. For instance, a 1:1,000 scale photo (where 1 unit on the photo equals 1,000 units on the ground) is considered a large scale;

**Smaller Scale**: Conversely, a small-scale aerial photograph covers a larger area on the ground but with less detail. A 1:100,000 scale photo, for example, would show a much larger area with less detail per unit of area on the photo.

### **Scale of aerial photos**

1\) Scale = map distance : actual distance

2\) Scale = camera focal length : flying height above terrain (scale decreases as flying higher)

## Distortion of airphotos

#### Types of distortion:

-   Relief Displacement : Location of tall objects displaced from their true location

    -   Amount and direction of displacements depends on object's location in a photo

-   Terrain Variability: scale of map differs across elevations.

    -   Flying over a complex terrain, the scale could be different (higher terrain should correspond with flying higher)

-   Camera tilt distortion: airplanes fly imperfectly and camera tilt makes views slightly oblique, causing distortion

#### Orthophotos

\- Air photo that has been geometrically corrected to a constant scale

\- remove distortion due to uneven terrain, camera tilt

\- objects appear in their true locations

## Air Photo Interpretation

#### **Photogrammetry** - Info about 3D features

science and technology of obtaining spatial measurements from photographs (determining object heights)

-   Stereoscopic version: our brain uses the differences in what each eye sees to reconstruct 3D space

    -   Overlap between stereo pairs of air photos allow us to vision in 3D

    -   Sophisticated software now making measurements on stereo pairs.

#### **Air photo interpretation**

Identification of objects to generate maps and reports of observations, use characteristics of images: **shape, size, pattern (planted area/natural), tone, texture (tells us structure, the composition of area), shadows, site, association**.

Challenges: 1) Overhead, unfamiliar perspective; 2) Unfamiliar and variable scales and resolutions; 3) Use of wavelengths outside the visible spectrum
