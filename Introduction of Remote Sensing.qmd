# **Ariel Photographs**

Remote sensing data came from **platforms** that carrying **sensors**

-   Early platforms used for aerial photos include balloons and kites, even pigeons

**Aerial Photographs:**

-   (After the WWI, planes and pilots and cameras spread, widespread use in soil surveys ... Today, aerial photography mainly used for historical coverage and with different **spatial resolution**)

-   Aerial photos can take in vertical (creating maps) or oblique (more use in natural purposes (disasters...))

## **Scales of aerial photos**

### **Large-scale VS. small scale**

When we talk about a "larger scale" in aerial photography, it means that the images show a smaller area of the earth's surface but with more detail.

**Larger Scale**: A large-scale aerial photograph covers a smaller area on the ground but shows that area in greater detail. For instance, a 1:1,000 scale photo (where 1 unit on the photo equals 1,000 units on the ground) is considered a large scale;

**Smaller Scale**: Conversely, a small-scale aerial photograph covers a larger area on the ground but with less detail. A 1:100,000 scale photo, for example, would show a much larger area with less detail per unit of area on the photo.

### **Scale of aerial photos**

1\) Scale = map distance : actual distance

2\) Scale = camera focal length : flying height above terrain (scale decreases as flying higher)

## Distortion of airphotos

#### Types of distortion:

-   Relief Displacement : Location of tall objects displaced from their true location

    -   Amount and direction of displacements depends on object's location in a photo

-   Terrain Variability: scale of map differs across elevations.

    -   Flying over a complex terrain, the scale could be different (higher terrain should correspond with flying higher)

-   Camera tilt distortion: airplanes fly imperfectly and camera tilt makes views slightly oblique, causing distortion

#### Orthophotos

\- Air photo that has been geometrically corrected to a constant scale

\- remove distortion due to uneven terrain, camera tilt

\- objects appear in their true locations

## Air Photo Interpretation

#### **Photogrammetry** - Info about 3D features

science and technology of obtaining spatial measurements from photographs (determining object heights)

-   Stereoscopic version: our brain uses the differences in what each eye sees to reconstruct 3D space

    -   Overlap between stereo pairs of air photos allow us to vision in 3D

    -   Sophisticated software now making measurements on stereo pairs.

#### **Air photo interpretation**

Identification of objects to generate maps and reports of observations, use characteristics of images: **shape, size, pattern (planted area/natural), tone, texture (tells us structure, the composition of area), shadows, site, association**.

Challenges: 1) Overhead, unfamiliar perspective; 2) Unfamiliar and variable scales and resolutions; 3) Use of wavelengths outside the visible spectrum

# **Electromagnetic Radiation**

False Color Composites (ÂÅáÂΩ©Ëâ≤ÂêàÊàê) : Infrared as red (vegetation reflects IR radiation, water absorbs it)

Remote sensing process: sunlight -\> surface -\> remote sensing

**Overall**

Travel in vacuum of space in speed of light

Higher energy, shorter wavelengths higher frequency

Visible spectrum range: 400-700 nm (0.4-0.7 ¬µm)

## Particle Theory

Particle Theory: describes EM radiation as particles (quanta/photons) with energy

C = v \* ùû¥( C=speed of light, v=frequency, ùû¥=wavelength)

Q = hv (Q-Energy of Quantum in J; h-Planck's constant, 6.24\*10-34 J/s; v=frequency)

Takeaway Point: Energy decreases with wavelength (shorter wavelength, higher frequency, higher energy)

## Wavelengths and Remote Sensors:

Longer wavelengths are harder to detect -\> 1) sensor needs to be more sensitive or 2) 'source' area need to become larger

## EM radiation and Temperature:

Stefan-Boltzmann law: describes amount of radiation emit by bodies, M=ùûÇ $T^4$

Peak wavelength of a blackbody decreases with T according to Wien's displacement law, $\gamma_m = A/T$

$\gamma_m$ is wavelength od maximum radiance

## Interactions of EM with atmosphere:

EM interactions with the atmosphere differ across particle size and abundance

Two situations happened:

1\) **Scattering:** unpredictable diffusion of radiation by particles in the atmosphere.

-   Three types depends on wavelengths and particle size

    -   Rayleigh Scattering (particles \<\< wavelength), CO2, O2, N2, inversely proportional to $\gamma^4$, longer wavelength, smaller scattering

        -   Sunsets is red because light scattering is more complete

    -   Mie Scattering (particle size \~ wavelength), dust, pollen, smoke, water vapor; affects longer wavelengths than Rayleigh scattering, tends to scatter in the forward direction

    -   Non-selective scatter (particle size \> wavelength), water droplets, scatter wavelengths equally thus causing a white appearance, this is why clouds is white

2\) **Absorption:** only some radiation reaches the earth's surface

# Reflectance

Energy at the earth's surface: E~I~= E~R~ + E~A~ + E~T,~ proportions are wavelengths dependent

**Satellites typically measure E~R~ in Wm-2**

E~R~ depends on 1) amount of incident radiation and 2) properties of the surface

Spectral reflectance = E~R~ / E~I~ (expressed in %)

Sensors typically measure the total radiance in a given range of wavelengths (not a continuous)

## Specular Reflection VS. Diffuse Reflection:

Specular Reflection: angle of reflection = angle of incidence; Mirror-like reflections

Diffuse Reflection: reflect uniformly in all directions

What influences diffuse vs. specular reflection?

1\) Roughness of a surface

**Types of geometric effects:**

1\) Differential shading, camera with shade part of the tree is different than the part of tree covered by light

2\) Differential scattering,

3\) Specular reflection, no identities will be told.

**How do we understand, model, correct the geometric effects?**

Bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF): mathematical function that predicts, for a given project, what reflectance will be at any viewing angle and sun elevation angle

path radiance: radiance that have been scattered

## **Named Spectral Regions:**

Gamma and X-rays: almost fully blocked by atmosphere, not using in remote sensing

UV wavelengths: mostly blocked by earth's atmosphere (ozone), some applications for mapping oil spills

Visible wavelengths: atmospheric window allow most visible light through; panchromatic imagery, measures reflectance in all visible wavelengths

Infrared-Near infrared (0.7-1.4um): many applications in RS, vegetation monitoring and delineating water bodies

Infrared-Short-wave infrared (SWIR, 1.4-3um): soil moisture, vegetation water content, geology

Infrared-Far-infrared (3-1000 um): emitted by warm objects, used to measure earth surface temperatures, detect fires

Microwave (0.1-3 cm): wavelengths used in RADAR

# Digital Imagery

Optical remote sensing products come in the form of a digital image

## Structural of Digital Imagery

A digital image is a raster, i.e. a 2D array of digital numbers (DNs), DNs correspond to the EM energy measured in each pixel

Panchromatic band: 1) blue, green, red Ôºàyellow is green and red), we had three cones in our eyes, correspond each band

## Spectral band

Warm-up questions: What are spatial and temporal resolution? Name one factor (characteristics of a satellite or sensor) that you think influences spatial and/or temporal resolution.

Spatial Resolution: How many pixels an area; tells you the details of a picture; the distance the satellite take a photo from

Temporal Resolution: the frequency the sensor takes the photo; storage & frequency take the photo

Digital Imagery: raster stack of spectral band images

What determines image resolution?

Altitude: how far from earth

Inclination: degrees deviates refer to equatorial , 0 degree the same as equatorial, 90 degree vertically refer to earth

Eccentricity: e=0, circle; to ellipse
