## Standard Deviation and Standard Error

**The standard deviation (SD)** measures the amount of variability, or dispersion, from the individual data values to the mean; SD indicates how accurately the mean represents sample data.

```{r}
sd(x)
```

**The standard error of the mean (SEM)** measures how far the sample mean (average) of the data is likely to be from the true population mean (uncertainty in means)

```{r}
# Method 1:
standard_error <- sd(x) / sqrt(length(x))
# Method 2:
install.packages("plotrix")                           
library("plotrix") 
std.error(x)    
```
